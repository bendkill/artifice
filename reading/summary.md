# Perturbations

Images from scientific experiments involve many potential perturbations, some
intentional and others unintentional. There are two primary groups of perturbations:
* Measured
* Unmeasured

Measured perturbations result from the underlying target for prediction, usually
location. Possible targets include:
* Object location (in one or more dimensions)
* Object orientation (rotation on one or more axes)
* Number/type of objects

Unmeasured perturbations, on the other hand, result from unintended aspects of
the experiment, e.g. changes in lighting. Unmeasured perturbations usually
include:
* Lighting
* Object Shape
* Specular highlights
* Movement of extraneous objects

Perturbations may be further categorized as affecting either the whole of an
image or merely a single object in an image. These categories are referred to as
* Universal
* Isolated
